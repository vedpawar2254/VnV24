# VnV24

Style guide for VnV24

1. Colour Palette

Since you’re dealing with fragrance & essential oils, the palette can evoke luxury + nature (premium feel + organic origins). Consider one of these thematic palettes and then apply the 60-30-10 rule: ~60% base, ~30% secondary, ~10% accent.

Suggested palette

Base / Neutral: Off-white / Cream (#F8F6F2) or Soft Ivory.

Secondary: Deep Forest Green (#2E3E2F) or Warm Taupe (#8B7D6B).

Accent / Highlight: Gold (#D6A953) or Copper (#B67C55) for luxury feel.

Text Dark: Charcoal (#333333) for body text.

Text Light / On Dark: Pale Gray (#FAFAFA) if used on dark backgrounds.

Application

Use base neutral for most backgrounds (cards, section panels) → gives calm, premium feel.

Use secondary colour for large text/section headings or product category backgrounds.

Use accent for CTAs (Add to Cart, Shop Now), badges (New, Best Seller).

Use charcoal for body copy, ensure high contrast (WCAG). From typography/colour advice: ensure contrast ratio at least ~4.5:1 for normal text.

Keep palette limited (2-3 main colours + accent) to avoid visual clutter.

Mood / Justification

The use of greens/earth-tones connects to natural essential oils, herbal elements.

The gold/accent gives the premium fragrance side (luxury scents, high-end feel).

Neutral backgrounds help product photography stand out (important for fragrances).

Avoid overly bright/neon colours because the category leans toward calm luxury rather than “flashy” tech. (See advice: earthy tones with soft accents for wellness/organic brands).

2. Typography

Good typography is key for readability and brand tone. Here are guidelines:

Font-family choices

Use two font families maximum: one for headings (display) and one for body text. This prevents clutter.

For headings: consider a refined serif or elegant sans-serif with personality (e.g., “Playfair Display”, “Libre Baskerville”, or a high-contrast sans like “Poppins” with refined weight).

For body: use a clean, legible sans-serif (e.g., “Inter”, “Roboto”, “Lato”) at comfortable sizes.

Avoid too many decorative fonts (especially for body) — legibility is paramount.

Sizes & hierarchy

Body text: minimum ~16px equivalent (1rem) on desktop for readability.

Heading sizes could be: H1 ~32px (2rem), H2 ~24px (1.5rem), H3 ~20px (1.25rem) (adjust for mobile).

Line-height for body: ~1.5 (150%) for comfortable reading.

Headings: slightly tighter line-height but clear spacing.

Use consistent prefix/suffix for styling in Tailwind (e.g., text-2xl, text-lg, leading-tight etc).

Avoid using ALL CAPS everywhere; reserve all-caps for small headings or UI elements where appropriate. Overuse reduces readability.

Colour for typography

Body text colour: Charcoal (#333333) on off-white background (#F8F6F2).

Ensure contrast meets accessibility — e.g., text vs background should have ratio ~4.5:1 for normal text.

Headings may use the secondary colour (Deep Forest Green) for subtle brand accent, but ensure still readable.

Links/buttons: accent colour (Gold) or secondary if appropriate. On hover or focus, slightly darker/lighter variant.

Spacing & readability

Margins: generous whitespace around headings and between sections to give premium feel.

Content width: limit max width for body content (~60–75 characters per line) to enhance readability.

Avoid long lines in paragraphs; break into paragraphs often, use bullet points for features/benefits.

3. UI Component Style & Interaction Hints

Since you asked “only design guide” (and not functionalities), here are stylistic decisions for components.

Buttons (CTA)

Primary CTA (e.g., “Add to Cart”, “Buy Now”): background = Accent Gold (#D6A953), text = Charcoal or off-white if on accent.

Hover state: slightly darker gold or light shadow to show depth.

Secondary buttons: background = Transparent, border = Secondary Deep Green (#2E3E2F), text = Secondary.

Rounded corners moderate (e.g., rounded-md), not ultra-rounded.

Padding generous (e.g., px-6 py-3) to give premium “button” feel.

Cards / Product Tiles

Background: Base/off-white (#F8F6F2) or white if your site uses white.

Border: light grey (#E0E0E0) or subtle shadow for elevation.

On hover: elevate slightly (shadow shadow-lg or translate up a px) to indicate interactiveness.

Use high-quality imagery; set consistent ratio (e.g., square or portrait) for uniform grid.

Text and headings in cards

Product title: Heading font, size ~1.125rem (18px) on desktop, colour = Charcoal.

Price: Use either Charcoal or Secondary colour; for discounts use accent gold for original price maybe struck-through.

Badges: e.g., “New”, “Best Seller” — background = Accent Gold, text = white or Charcoal depending on contrast.

Backgrounds & sections

Alternate background colours between sections: e.g., off-white for general sections, white for emphasis, maybe very light taupe (#FAF9F7) for subtle variation.

Use large images in hero sections; overlay text in secondary colour (Deep Green) with white or off-white.

Typography details

For headings across product pages use secondary colour to tie brand.

For body text (descriptions, usage instructions) keep Charcoal on off-white for readability.

Use italic or light weight sparingly (e.g., for scent notes).

Icons & accents

Use minimal line-icons in secondary colour (Deep Green) for features (e.g., 100 % Natural, Free Shipping).

Use accent gold for small decorative lines or separators (thin line in accent colour) to emphasise luxury.

Navigation & footer

Nav bar background: Base/off-white or white. Text links: Charcoal or Deep Green. On hover: accent gold underline or text colour changes to gold.

Footer background: Deep Green (#2E3E2F) or Charcoal (#333333) for contrast. Text links in off-white (#F8F6F2).

Use accent gold for social icons hover states.

4. Brand Voice & Imagery Style (Visual Tone)

Imagery: Use natural textures (wood, leaves, oils) + sleek product shots (glass bottles, metallic caps) to mix “nature” + “luxury” vibe.

Avoid overly saturated bright colours in product imagery; keep palette consistent with your brand palette.

Use generous whitespace around product imagery and text; premium brands often “breathe”. (See e-commerce homepage guideline: simple is better).

Use consistent photo styling: lighting, background, proportion. On product pages: macro details of bottle, drop, oils.

Use decorative elements minimally (e.g., subtle gradients or textures in background) but ensure they don’t distract from product.
